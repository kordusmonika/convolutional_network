Convolutional neural network problems


1.	Cat_dog_cnn
Binary classification problem( cat vd dog) based on 3 convolutional layers with 32 and 64 filters. The first dense contains of 64 neurons with 1183808 parameters. As a result we have only one neuron, which indicates binary classification (Dog or Cat).
Final result: Loss : 54 % Accuracy: 74%

2.	Imagenet
Image class prediction based on Imagenet dataset (ResNet50)


3. DataWorkshop Transformation 3 - dw_matrix_road_sign 

 Another fantastic initiative (check out for more details: https://dataworkshop.eu/) organized by Dataworkshop and led by CEO  Vladimir Alekseichenko. This time we are going through concolutional neural network with the main goal to predict road signs.
