Convolutional neural network problems


Basic_cnn:
Architecture based on 3 convolutional layers with 32 and 64 filters. The first dense contains of 64 neurons with 1183808 parameters. As a result we have only one neuron, which indicates binary classification (Dog or Cat).

Final result: Loss : 54 % Accuracy: 74%
